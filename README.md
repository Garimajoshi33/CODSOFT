<h3>Task 1 - Number Guessing Game</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. The game generates a random number within a specified range and prompts the user to guess the number with feedback until the correct number is guessed.

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><h5>Random Number Generation:</h5> Generates a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
<li><h5>User Input & Feedback:</h5> Prompts the user to guess the number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.</li>
<li><h5></h5>Attempt Limitation: Limits the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.</li>
<li>Multiple Rounds: Allows users to play multiple rounds.</li>
<li>Scoring System: Displays the user's score based on the number of attempts or rounds won.</li>
Task 2 - Student Grade Calculator
Overview
This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. It calculates students' grades based on their marks in various subjects.

Features
Input Marks: Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
Calculate Total Marks: Sums up the marks obtained in all subjects.
Average Percentage: Calculates the average percentage by dividing total marks by the number of subjects.
Grade Calculation: Assigns grades based on the average percentage.
Display Results: Shows total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade.
Task 3 - ATM Interface
Overview
This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. It simulates an ATM interface with various banking operations.

Features
ATM Class: Represents the ATM machine.
User Interface: Provides options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
Methods Implementation: Includes withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance() methods.
Bank Account Class: Stores the user's account balance.
Integration: Connects the ATM class with the bank account class to modify the balance.
Input Validation: Ensures user inputs are within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
User Feedback: Displays messages based on transaction success or failure.
