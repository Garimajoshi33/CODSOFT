<h2>Task 1 - Number Guessing Game</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. The game generates a random number within a specified range and prompts the user to guess the number with feedback until the correct number is guessed.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Random Number Generation:</h4> Generates a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
<li><h4>User Input & Feedback:</h4> Prompts the user to guess the number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.</li>
<li><h4>Attempt Limitation:</h4> Limits the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.</li>
<li><h4>Multiple Rounds:</h4> Allows users to play multiple rounds.</li>
<li><h4>Scoring System:</h4> Displays the user's score based on the number of attempts or rounds won.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Task 2 - Student Grade Calculator</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. It calculates students' grades based on their marks in various subjects.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Input Marks:</h4> Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.</li>
<li><h4>Calculate Total Marks:</h4> Sums up the marks obtained in all subjects.</li>
<li><h4>Average Percentage:</h4> Calculates the average percentage by dividing total marks by the number of subjects.</li>
<li><h4>Grade Calculation:</h4> Assigns grades based on the average percentage.</li>
<li><h4>Display Results:</h4> Shows total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task 3 - ATM Interface</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project is part of my Java Programming Virtual Internship at Codsoft. It simulates an ATM interface with various banking operations.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>ATM Class:</h4> Represents the ATM </li>  
<li><h4>User Interface:</h4>Provides options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.</li>
<li><h4>Methods Implementation:</h4> Includes withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance() methods.</li>
<li><h4>Bank Account Class:</h4> Stores the user's account balance.1</li>
<li><h4>Integration:</h4> Connects the ATM class with the bank account class to modify the balance.</li>
<li><h4>Input Validation:</h4> Ensures user inputs are within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).</li>
<li><h4>User Feedback:</h4> Displays messages based on transaction success or failure.</li>
</ul>
